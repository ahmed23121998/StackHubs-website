ERP Hub
========


Intro
======
The ERP Hub unifies finance, supply chain, sales, projects, and operations on a governed data model with clear roles, approvals, and auditability.
Every engagement starts with a Gap Analysis & Process Discovery phase: we map current processes, controls, and data quality, then define a target operating model with measurable KPIs.
Implementation follows a fit-for-purpose approach—minimal customization, strong master-data standards, and integration patterns that keep the core clean.
We connect ERP with CRM, ecommerce, WMS/TMS, IoT/SCADA, and analytics platforms so decisions are driven by real-time data.
As part of your digital transformation journey, we align technology, organization, and change management to deliver adoption, not just go-live.
Cutover is rehearsed with playbooks and automated tests; after go-live, support models (hypercare, enhancement packs, managed services) keep the platform stable and evolving with the business.


What We Deliver
===============

SAP (S/4HANA & Ecosystem)
=========================
We implement S/4HANA using a fit-to-standard method across Finance (FI/CO), Procure-to-Pay (MM/Ariba), Order-to-Cash (SD), Production (PP), EWM, and project accounting.
The program begins with Gap Analysis to baseline processes, controls, and reporting, then moves through blueprinting, data governance, and phased releases.
User experience is modernized with Fiori; extensions run on BTP, so custom logic is API-driven and upgrade-safe.
Data migration is industrialized—cleansing, reconciliation, and rehearsal runs—so balances, open items, and stock land correctly.
Controls and SoD are embedded in roles and workflows; MENA compliance (e-invoicing/tax packs) is supported.
Post go-live, our Run & Evolve services cover release management, regression testing, automation/RPA for closing and matching, and value dashboards tied to business KPIs—backed by tiered support models (hypercare to managed application services).


Odoo (Community, Online, and Odoo.sh)
======================================
We deliver Odoo across all editions—Community, Odoo Online, and Odoo.sh—selecting the model that fits governance, cost, and extensibility.
A formal Gap Analysis precedes configuration: senior Odoo functional consultants, implementation leads, and Odoo developers map core processes (Accounting, Sales, Purchase, Inventory/WMS, MRP, Projects, HR/Payroll, Field Service) and define a clean target design.
We prioritize configuration with Studio, server-side rules, and approvals to avoid unnecessary custom code; when extensions add value, we build them as modular Python apps with disciplined versioning and CI/CD (especially on Odoo.sh with staging and automated tests).
Integrations connect Odoo to e-commerce, payments, shipping, POS, external BI, and legacy ERP via secure APIs/webhooks; data migration uses validated templates and automated reconciliation to reduce rework.
Leadership gains real-time insight into cash, margin, inventory turns, aging, and fulfillment through curated dashboards and alerts that drive action.
After go-live, we provide support models—hypercare, enhancement sprints, and managed Odoo services—so the platform scales smoothly as teams and volumes grow, fully aligned with your digital transformation roadmap.
