AI Hub
======


Intro
------
AI at StackHubs is built to deliver measurable outcomes — not experiments.
We design end-to-end pipelines from data acquisition to production MLOps with governance, observability, and security by default.
Models run where they create the most value: on edge gateways for real-time control, or in cloud for scale and analytics.
Every solution is integrated with your existing systems (ERP/CRM, SIEM, VMS, data lake) and instrumented for audit and ROI.
We support multilingual use cases including Arabic/RTL, with human-in-the-loop review where accuracy and compliance matter.
Lifecycle management covers drift detection, retraining, and safe rollback so AI stays reliable in production.
The result is an AI capability that’s practical, maintainable, and aligned with business KPIs.


What We Deliver
--------------

1) Computer Vision
-------------------
Real-time analytics on cameras for counting, intrusion, direction, heatmaps, and access control across sites.
Edge inference on gateways/NVRs with GPU acceleration; cloud aggregation for fleet analytics and model updates.
Pre/post-processing for occlusion, lighting, and privacy masks with configurable retention policies.
Integrations to VMS/ACS/SIEM trigger alerts, door actions, or tickets in ITSM automatically.
Multi-camera tracking and re-ID link events across entrances, corridors, and zones for full journey context.
MLOps pipelines handle dataset curation, accuracy benchmarks, A/B deployments, and continuous improvement.

2) Document Intelligence (OCR + Forms + RPA)
---------------------------------------------
Layout-aware OCR extracts structured data from invoices, IDs, POs, delivery notes, and contracts with field validation.
Entity capture (names, dates, totals, line items) with confidence scores and exception queues for human-in-the-loop.
Arabic and bilingual documents supported (RTL, stamps, seals, and handwriting variants where feasible).
Business rules and anti-fraud checks (duplicates, vendor mismatches, tax/IBAN validation) before posting.
RPA workflows post directly into ERP/CRM, attach evidence, and update approval status automatically.
Dashboards track STP rate, turnaround time, and accuracy to keep processes auditable and scalable.

3) Anomaly Detection & Predictive Maintenance
------------------------------------------------

Time-series and streaming analytics learn each asset/site’s normal to catch outliers early.
Applies to networks, IoT fleets, machines, and fraud signals with unsupervised and hybrid models.
Root-cause hints correlate sensors, logs, and events to cut MTTD/MTTR and prevent repeat failures.
Health scores and remaining-useful-life (RUL) estimates drive proactive work orders in CMMS/ERP.
Edge agents buffer during outages and sync summaries to the cloud for global insight and governance.
Drift monitoring, retraining windows, and blue/green rollouts keep models accurate in production.

4) Speech & Conversational AI
------------------------------
Live transcription, summaries, and sentiment for calls and meetings in Arabic and English.
Voicebots/chatbots handle routine requests with guardrails, handoff to agents, and full conversation history.
RAG-based assistants connect to your knowledge bases and ticketing to answer with cited sources.
Acoustic enhancements reduce noise/overlap; diarization separates speakers for clean analytics.
Supervision tools review accuracy, bias, and leakage risks with redaction and retention controls.
Contact-center KPIs (AHT, FCR, CSAT) improve through intent routing, coaching cues, and after-call summaries.

5) Forecasting & Decision Optimization
--------------------------------------

Statistical and ML forecasting for demand, inventory, staffing, capacity, and energy consumption.
Scenario planning simulates shocks, seasonality, and promotions with confidence intervals and alerts.
Optimization engines schedule workforce, routes, or production under real-world constraints and SLAs.
What-if tools expose trade-offs (service vs. cost vs. risk) with executive-level dashboards.
Tight integration with ERP/MES/SCM ensures recommended actions flow into operations automatically.
Continuous backtesting and champion–challenger deployment keep models honest and improving.
