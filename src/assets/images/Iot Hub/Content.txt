IoT Hub
========
Intro
------
The IoT Hub connects assets, environments, and people through secure devices, resilient connectivity, and real-time data pipelines.
We design end-to-end architectures—from sensor selection and edge gateways to cloud platforms and integrations with ERP/CMMS/SCADA.
Connectivity is engineered for each use case: Wi-Fi/6E for campus, BLE for tagging, LPWAN for low-power fleets, and 4G/5G/private-LTE for mobility and remote sites.
Security is built in with device identity, least-privilege network access, encrypted transport, and continuous posture monitoring.
Data moves through streaming and digital-twin models so operations, maintenance, and business apps can act in seconds, not hours.
The result is an industrial-grade IoT foundation that scales safely, reduces downtime, and unlocks new automation and visibility across your sites.
What We Deliver


1) Industrial IoT & Smart Facilities
------------------------------------
We instrument production lines, utilities, and buildings with sensors for condition, energy, safety, and environment.
Edge gateways normalize field protocols (Modbus, BACnet, OPC-UA, CAN) and bridge to IT networks securely.
We integrate with PLC/SCADA/BMS to stream alarms and KPIs while respecting control-system boundaries.
Device identity, certificates, and secure boot protect endpoints from spoofing and tampering.
Digital-twin models mirror assets to track state, utilization, and maintenance history.
Outcomes: fewer site visits, faster fault isolation, and a single operational view across facilities.

2) Connectivity & Device Management
-----------------------------------
Right-sized connectivity per fleet: Wi-Fi/6E, BLE/RTLS, LoRa/LPWAN, 4G/5G/private-LTE, and secure backhaul.
We implement onboarding at scale (DPSK/certificates), profile policies, and micro-segmentation for IoT traffic.
Automated lifecycle: enrollment, provisioning, firmware/OTA, key rotation, and decommissioning with audit trails.
Health telemetry and anomaly rules detect chatty or misbehaving devices before they impact apps.
Gateway high-availability and offline buffering keep data flowing during WAN outages.
Unified consoles show inventory, status, compliance, and performance by site and device type.

3) Data Platform & Integration
------------------------------
Streaming pipelines ingest time-series, events, and video into a governed lakehouse with role-based access.
We build APIs and connectors to ERP/CMMS/EMS and analytics tools so insights drive work orders and actions.
Schema, retention, and PII policies keep data useful and compliant across teams.
Dashboards surface live KPIs—OEE/energy/condition—plus drill-downs to device level.
Rules engines trigger alerts, ticketing, and workflows with throttling and deduplication.
Optional document intelligence and computer vision modules enrich events with OCR or camera analytics.

4) Analytics, Alerts & Predictive Maintenance
---------------------------------------------
Models learn each asset/site’s “normal” and flag drift or failure precursors early.
We correlate sensors, logs, and usage to produce root-cause hints and reduce MTTD/MTTR.
RUL (remaining-useful-life) and risk scoring prioritize maintenance and spare-parts planning.
What-if simulators estimate impact on throughput, energy, and SLAs before changes go live.
Closed-loop automation can adjust setpoints or create work orders automatically.
Governed MLOps handles retraining, versioning, and rollback for safe, stable accuracy.
