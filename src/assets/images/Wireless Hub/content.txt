Wireless Hub
============

Intro
-----

Wireless is no longer an add-on; it’s the primary access layer for users, devices, and IoT.
Our Wireless Hub delivers end-to-end Wi-Fi architectures that combine RF design, security, and automation to achieve a consistent optimum experience at scale.
We design for single strength, coverage, capacity, and engineering high-density environments with Wi-Fi 6/6E and ready for 7 using OFDMA and optimized channel plans in 2.4/5/6 GHz.
Assurance is built in: active & predictive surveys, spectrum analysis, heatmaps, and continuous KPIs for latency, throughput, and roaming.
Access is identity-driven with WPA3-Enterprise, 802.1X/EAP-TLS, NAC/Zero-Trust policy, and clean separation of production vs. guest traffic.
We integrate wireless with the wider campus fabric (wired/SD-Access), deliver cloud-managed or controller-based operations, and support indoor, outdoor, and industrial sites.
The outcome: fast, reliable, and cost-effective wireless that empowers mobility, VoIP/real-time apps, and large-scale IoT—anywhere.



What We Deliver
===============

1) RF Strategy, Predictive Design & On-Site Validation
-------------------------------------------------------
We capture use-cases, device mix, concurrency, and SLAs, then translate them into an RF model (materials, AP placement, antenna patterns, channel widths, Tx power, data-rate thresholds).
We use world-class tools like Ekahau to do our predictive design, produce heatmaps for coverage (RSSI/SNR), capacity, CCI/ACI, and 6-GHz viability, so deployment starts from a known-good baseline.
We verify in the field with active/passive surveys, measuring real throughput, loss, jitter, roaming times, DHCP/DNS success, and retry rates.
Spectrum analysis identifies non-Wi-Fi interferers (BLE, microwave, cameras, IoT), and we prescribe mitigations: clean channels, directional antennas, shielding, or relocation.
Turn-up tuning covers cell size, power/channel plans, client steering, and sticky-client handling to hit target KPIs.
Deliverables include updated heatmaps, survey files, spectrum captures, and an acceptance report mapped to your SLAs.

2) High-Density Performance Engineering (Wi-Fi 6/6E/7-ready)
--------------------------------------------------------------
We design for crowded venues with OFDMA scheduling, MU-MIMO, BSS coloring, and precise cell sizing to maximize airtime efficiency.
Client-steering and band-balancing policies keep the load even across 2.4/5/6 GHz while honoring device capabilities.
End-to-end QoS ensures that voice, video, and real-time applications receive deterministic latency and jitter.
Roaming is optimized using 802.11r/k/v, fast BSS transition, and minimized re-authentication penalties.
We harden DHCP/DNS paths, prune broadcast/multicast traffic, and tune retry/CTS thresholds for enhanced reliability.
Performance baselines and stress tests validate throughput per client profile under peak concurrency.

3) Secure Access & Segmentation (Prod / Guest)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Identity-driven access with WPA3-Enterprise, 802.1X/EAP-TLS, and granular NAC policies enforces least-privilege by user/device posture.
We implement per-user VLANs or group tags for micro-segmentation without SSID sprawl.
Guest and contractor flows are isolated end-to-end with rate limits, time bounds, and audit trails.
Certificate lifecycle (enrollment/renewal/revocation) integrates with MDM/Intune/JAMF for zero-touch onboarding.
Rogue AP/WIPS policies detect and contain unauthorized radios safely.
The wireless team also engages with the network team to ensure Network Policy sets are mirrored into the wired campus fabric for consistent enforcement.

4) IoT & Location Services
---------------------------
Our wireless team integrates with the IoT hub team to build IoT profiles for scanners, sensors, cameras, AGVs—right power, rates, and security for low-power and high-density fleets.
Onboarding options include DPSK, certificates, or MAC-based exceptions with tight network scopes.
We deploy BLE/ULP grids and calibrate RTLS to accuracy targets for wayfinding and asset tracking.
Northbound APIs stream location/events to CMMS/ERP/EMS platforms.
IoT traffic is isolated with rate limits and anomaly alerts to protect business apps.
Operational runbooks define lifecycle tasks: adds/moves, firmware, and security rotation.

5) Controllers, Cloud-Managed Ops & Automation
-----------------------------------------------
Choose controller-based or cloud-managed WLAN; both deliver RRM, policy, and zero-touch provisioning.
We standardize configs with templates and expose change workflows via APIs/GitOps for auditability.
Automations cover adds/moves/changes, bulk firmware, and config drift detection with guardrails.
Health telemetry streams to your NOC/SOC for correlation with wired, DHCP/DNS, and app layers.
Role-based access and approval flows keep operations safe and fast.
Scheduled maintenance windows use staged rollouts and rollback plans to minimize impact.

6) Assurance, KPIs & Continuous Optimization
---------------------------------------------
We operate to explicit targets: ≥95% coverage, ≥98% roaming success, <30 ms latency for critical apps, and throughput per persona.
Dashboards track SNR, retries, MCS distribution, roaming times, DHCP/DNS success, and client experience.
Synthetic tests validate paths to key apps and detect degradations before users do.
Quarterly reviews compare trends, incidents, and changes against KPIs and propose tuning actions.
Event correlation ties RF changes to ticket volumes and user satisfaction.
Reports are executive-friendly with technical appendices for engineering follow-up.

7) Guest Access & Captive Portal Experience
-------------------------------------------
Branded portals with voucher/SMS/social/SSO and granular T&Cs.
Walled-garden and bandwidth caps protect core services while keeping UX smooth.
Full segmentation from production, with logging and abuse controls.
Short-lived credentials, device limits, and sponsored guest workflows.
Marketing/analytics hooks (optional) for visit patterns and dwell time.
Operational playbooks define sponsor approval and exception handling.

8) Documentation, Handover & Support Models
-------------------------------------------
You receive as-built diagrams, RF plans, finals of heatmaps/surveys, inventory, and runbooks.
Admin training covers troubleshooting flows, KPIs, and safe-change practices.
We provide warranty/firmware matrices and lifecycle roadmaps.
Support tiers: design-assist, escalation-only, or fully managed Wi-Fi with SLAs.
Proactive reviews keep configs aligned with device trends and regulations.
A single contact window coordinates vendors, carriers, and campus integrations.
